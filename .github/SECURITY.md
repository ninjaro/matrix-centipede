# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate reports of any vulnerabilities.

## Reporting

Please use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature to submit
security issues. Alternatively, you may email
[yaroslav.riabtsev@rwth-aachen.de](mailto:yaroslav.riabtsev@rwth-aachen.de).

We’ll *totally* try to acknowledge your report within **5 business days**
(give or take... forever). As for critical issues — yeah, we *aim* to tackle
those within **30 days** of confirming they’re real, unless they’re
complicated, confusing, or we just forget.

## Supported Versions

At this time the project has no official releases. Security fixes will be
applied to the `master` branch.
